# NextJS E-Commerce Shop
### Motivation
Create an efficient Photography Shop webpage using NextJS and Python Flask starting from scratch.
### Technologies
Client: NextJS
Server: Python Flask
Database: SQLite

### Requirements
Node >=18
Python 3.10 

### Running
GitHub: https://github.com/pdj1183/Projects

Iâ€™ve created a run.sh bash script located in /bin that will create the python virtual environment, install dependancies and start the client and server.

```bash
./bin/run.sh
```

After the server and client are started up the webpage is available at http://localhost:3000/
